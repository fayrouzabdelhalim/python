What I Learned from This Task
Throughout this task, I explored various ways to analyze and manipulate Pokémon data using Pandas. Here’s a summary of what I learned:

1. Filtering Data
I learned how to select specific Pokémon based on different conditions. I was able to:

Find slow Pokémon with Speed ≤ 10
Identify all Legendary Pokémon
Select Pokémon that have Fire as Type 1 and Flying as Type 2
2. Counting and Summarizing Data
I practiced counting Pokémon that fit specific conditions, such as:

The number of Pokémon that have Poison as either Type 1 or Type 2
Finding the most common Type 1 among Legendary Pokémon
Counting how many Pokémon belong to each type
3. Finding Extremes (Max, Min, and Outliers)
I found that Avalugg has the highest Defense among Ice-type Pokémon
I learned about outliers, which are extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data
I explored how to detect outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
4. Understanding the Effects of Outliers
I discovered that outliers affect the mean but do not significantly impact the median
This is important because extreme values can distort data analysis, making some statistics unreliable
5. Visualizing Data
I learned that boxplots help detect outliers by showing the distribution of values
I explored how bar charts can display the frequency of different Pokémon types
How This Helps Me
I now know how to filter, count, and analyze Pokémon data efficiently
I understand how to detect and interpret outliers in datasets
I can summarize distributions and find trends in data
This task gave me a strong foundation in data analysis with Pandas. I can now explore more advanced topics like grouping data or applying custom calculations.
